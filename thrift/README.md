# Readme
This folder contains go code generated by thrift.  It has been manually edited to correct the namespaces.  
If it is regenerated the following steps need to be taken:

* Move the generated folder that contains the topmost go code out of the deeply nested generated location to a more reasonable path.
* Move all the files in the package "storm" into their own folder named "storm"
* Change the file references in the other applications to correctly point to this new storm folder
